<p style="font-size:25px;">Mobile development</p>
Creating mobile applications is a little tricky, as there is more than one operating system for mobiles and the different operating system would require different languages for these applications. An operating system is the piece of software on your device that is responsible for dealing with the hardware of this device, it’s the layer that sits between the application you create and the hardware, whether it’s a mic or a touchscreen or GPS. The most two common operating systems are Android and IOS. Android is most commonly used in Samsung while IOS is used in Apple. To create Android apps, you’d need either Java or Kotlin, and for creating IOS applications you’d need Objective-C or Swift. Recently, it became possible to create mobile applications for both Android and IOS using Javascript or Dart.

Game development is one of the most interesting tracks there is, many developers enjoy it and there are developers who develop games just for having fun. Creating games requires what’s called a game engine, which is a software that is used as the infrastructure for building the game and defines what the game has and what it can do. If you’re familiar with Epic Games and Fortnight, Epic Games is, in fact, a game engine and Fortnight is built upon it. The languages used in game development are mostly C++, C# since it requires a lot of memory optimization and fast performance to create rich graphics. It’s not limited to C++ and C#, however, and it kind of is about which engine you’re using and which platform you’re targeting, Lua and Java are also very famous candidates in this industry.

If you’re interested in building websites there are two intertwining parts to look into.

First, there’s front-end development, which is the part of web development that creates the application that runs on your browser and adjusts the styling, the colors, the interactions. It’s basically concerned with what the user of a website sees. You are reading this blog on some screen which is shown to you by front-end code. Front-end basics start with HTML and CSS with use of JavaScript. Javascript has become one of the most dominant languages in the last few years for front-end work.

The other part for creating websites is back-end development, which is related to the server, the computer that runs the website software and serves it to the world. It’s mostly concerned with routing, which pages to deliver to the user when they visit a certain URL, it also communicates with the database that stores the website’s information and sends this data over to the user. Back-end development is where the magic happens and there are many options to choose from when it comes to a programming language, you can stick to Javascript just like in front-end development, or go with PHP, Ruby, C#, Elixir, Python, Erlang.
